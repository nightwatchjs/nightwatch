***
Automated end-to-end testing framework powered by [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and using [W3C Webdriver](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/) (formerly [Selenium](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol)).

Nightwatch is a complete and integrated solution for end-to-end testing of web applications and websites. It can also be used for Node.js unit and integration testing. 

## Nightwatch v2.0

####  [What's New](https://nightwatchjs.org/guide/getting-started/whats-new-v2.html) | [Release Notes](https://github.com/nightwatchjs/nightwatch/releases/tag/v2.0.0) | [Discussions](https://github.com/nightwatchjs/nightwatch/discussions)

We're delighted to announce that [Nightwatch v2.0](https://github.com/nightwatchjs/nightwatch/releases/tag/v2.0.0) is now available in the public NPM channel. Read the [what's new](https://nightwatchjs.org/guide/getting-started/whats-new-v2.html) docs page for an overview of the new features, improvements, and important changes.

Install with: 
```sh
npm i nightwatch
```

## Up &amp; Running in 2 Minutes:

#### 1. Install Nightwatch from NPM

```sh
$ npm install nightwatch --save-dev
```

#### 2. Install Browser Drivers:

##### Geckodriver (Firefox):
Geckodriver is the WebDriver service used to drive the [Mozilla Firefox Browser](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/).

```sh
$ npm install geckodriver --save-dev
```

##### Chromedriver:
Chromedriver is the WebDriver service used to drive the [Google Chrome Browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/).
```sh
$ npm install chromedriver --save-dev
```

or install everything with one line:

```sh
$ npm install nightwatch geckodriver chromedriver --save-dev
```

#### 3. Run a Demo Test:

Nightwatch comes with an `examples` folder containing several sample tests.

Below will run a basic test which opens the search engine [Ecosia.org](https://ecosia.org), searches for the term "nightwatch", and verifies if the term first result is the Nightwatch.js website.

```sh
$ npx nightwatch examples/tests/ecosia.js
```

## Manually Download Browser Drivers

Nightwatch uses a [WebDriver](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/) compatible server to control the browser. WebDriver is a W3C specification and industry standard which provides a platform and HTTP protocol to interact with a browser.
   
Nightwatch includes support for automatically managing the following services:
#### ChromeDriver 
- for running tests against the Chrome browser;
- download url: [https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads).

#### GeckoDriver
- for running tests against the Mozilla Firefox browser;
- download url: [https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases).
 
#### Selenium Standalone Server 
- allows managing multiple browser configurations in one place and also to make use of the [Selenium Grid](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/Grid2) service;
- the selenium server jar file `selenium-server-standalone-4.x.x.jar` can be downloaded from the Selenium releases page: https://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/index.html

> It's important to note that, while the Selenium Server was required with older Nightwatch versions (`v0.9` and prior), starting with version `1.0` the Selenium Server is no longer necessary.

Specific WebDriver setup guides can be found on the [Docs website](https://nightwatchjs.org/gettingstarted/browser-drivers-setup/). Legacy Selenium drivers setup guides along with debugging instructions can be found on the [**Wiki**](https://github.com/nightwatchjs/nightwatch/wiki).

## Examples
Examples below are written using Nightwatch 2.0.

#### Search for the term "Nightwatch.js" using:
- Google: [examples/tests/google.js](https://github.com/nightwatchjs/nightwatch/blob/main/examples/tests/google.js)
- DuckDuckGo: [examples/tests/duckDuckGo.js](https://github.com/nightwatchjs/nightwatch/blob/main/examples/tests/duckDuckGo.js)
- Ecosia.org: [examples/tests/ecosia.js](https://github.com/nightwatchjs/nightwatch/blob/main/examples/tests/ecosia.js)

#### Google search using page objects
- [examples/tests/googlePageObject.js](https://github.com/nightwatchjs/nightwatch/blob/main/examples/tests/googlePageObject.js)

#### ToDo App on AngularJs homepage
- [examples/tests/angularTest.js](https://github.com/nightwatchjs/nightwatch/blob/main/examples/tests/angularTest.js)
- this contains demo on how to use the new `element()` global api

You can run any of the examples by simply referring to the examples folder like below:
```sh
npx nightwatch examples/tests/angularTest.js
```

#### CucumberJS examples
 - [examples/cucumber-js/](https://github.com/nightwatchjs/nightwatch/tree/main/examples/cucumber-js)

The bundled config file which is auto-generated by Nightwatch on the first run (only if one is not already present in the project), contains configuration and examples for running the CucumberJS examples immediately, using the following:

```sh
npx nightwatch --env cucumber-js
```

You can also check out the [nightwatch-website-tests](https://github.com/nightwatchjs/nightwatch-website-tests) repo for example tests against the [nightwatchjs.org](https://nightwatchjs.org) website.

## Nightwatch unit tests
The tests for Nightwatch are written using [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/).

#### 1. Clone the project
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/nightwatchjs/nightwatch.git
$ cd nightwatch
$ npm install
```

#### 2. Run tests
To run the complete test suite:

```sh
$ npm test
```

To check test coverage, run the command:

```sh
$ npm run mocha-coverage
```
and then open the generated _coverage/index.html_ file in your browser.

## About Nightwatch
Nightwatch was initially built by [@pineviewlabs](https://github.com/pineviewlabs/) - an independent software consultancy based in Oslo, Norway, with help from [contributors](https://github.com/nightwatchjs/nightwatch/graphs/contributors). In mid 2021, Nightwatch has become a part of the [@BrowserStack](https://github.com/browserstack) family and it is being developed further at the BrowserStack Open-source Program Office. Read more on [our blog](https://nightwatchjs.org/blog/nightwatch-has-joined-the-browserstack-family.html).

We are thankful for everyone who supported Nightwatch on the [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/) platform.
