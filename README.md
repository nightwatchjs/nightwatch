- What is the base_url of your project? 

Nightwatch will do the entire setup for you based on your answers.

#### 3. Run a Demo Test:

Nightwatch comes with a few examples, which are automatically copied to your Nightwatch project during the setup and can also be used as boilerplate to write your own tests on top of them.

You can follow the instructions given at the end of the setup to run your first test with Nightwatch.
