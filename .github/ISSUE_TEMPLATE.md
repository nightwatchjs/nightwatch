- [ ] Please do not ask for assistance in the Issues list. Use the [Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nightwatchjs) or [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/nightwatch.js) to ask questions or seek help. 
- [ ] Use a meaningful title that would clearly and concisely explain the problem. For instance:
- not helpful: "Issue with tags"
- much better: "Tags don't work when combined with --skiptags option in some cases"
- [ ] Include a sample test (for complex scenarios) which would reproduce the problem you're experiencing. The test should be against a public url. The test and other info should be posted inline, attachments will not be accepted;
- [ ] Include the verbose output, if possible (run nightwatch with --verbose argument);
- [ ] Also include: Nightwatch version, Node.js version, OS version and Selenium server version (including any driver version if applicable);
- [ ] Please try to avoid sending issues you have with Selenium (e.g. works perfectly in ChromeDriver but not in Safari)
